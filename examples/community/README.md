# Community Examples

This directory is a placeholder for community-contributed examples. The long-
term plan is to host a dedicated `fluffyui-examples` repository and mirror
selected examples here.

If you have an example you want to share, open a PR with a short README and a
self-contained Go module or `main.go`.

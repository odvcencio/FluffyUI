# FluffyUI VS Code Extension (Skeleton)

This directory contains a minimal VS Code extension scaffold for FluffyUI.
It provides two starter commands:

- **FluffyUI: Open Docs** — opens `docs/getting-started.md`.
- **FluffyUI: Run Tests** — runs `go test ./...` in a terminal.

## Development

```bash
cd tools/vscode
npm install
npm run compile
```

This is a starting point for richer IDE features (snippets, diagnostics, and
commands tailored to FluffyUI projects).
